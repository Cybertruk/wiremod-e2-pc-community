This is the README.md file for wiremod-e2-pc-community.

Important notes:
I do not own the original ALX PC, this is for posting community dupes and E2/programs for the github found here -->.
(https://github.com/AlexALX/wiremod_e2_os/wiki/Installation)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:

Advanced Duplicator 2 (advdupe1 causes issues, don't use it)

Wiremod (the base for this whole github and the github above)

AlexALX's E2 PC (https://github.com/AlexALX/wiremod_e2_os/wiki/Installation)

Recommendations:

Some tunes (for vibing while you build)

All e2 extensions enabled

A local or singleplayer server for unlimited building

Information:
From what I've seen, to edit the wire sockets limit in vanilla, you have to open console and type sbox_maxwire_plugs (your number here) and sbox_maxwire_sockets (your number here) to prevent you from hitting the socket limit.

Again, I do not own the original version of AlexALX's E2 PC, and I want to make that clear. This github was made as a passion project and is only for uploading COMMUNITY
PC setups, programs, etc. Even if you don't want to, go give credit to AlexALX, he deserves a lot more credit than I do.








Thank you for reading the commu- I mean the gamer manifesto.
